# Sumo Snowballs

**Sumo Snowballs** is a 2D competitive game where two players face off in a snow-filled arena. Each player rolls a growing snowball, aiming to push their opponent out of the circular arena. It's a game of strategy, reflexes, and competitive spirit!

## Game Overview
Sumo Snowballs pits two players against each other in a snow-covered battleground. Players roll snowballs that grow in size as they move. The objective is to use your snowball to push your opponent out of the arena, winning rounds until the final victory. The bigger your snowball, the stronger your push, but it also makes maneuvering more challenging!

### Features
- **Two-Player Competitive Gameplay**: Play against a friend on the same keyboard.
- **Snowball Growth Mechanic**: Move around to grow your snowball, making it bigger and stronger, but slowing you down as it grows!
- **Harvest Button**: If your snowball breaks, rapidly press the harvest button to rebuild!
- **Launch Mechanic**: Use your snowball as a projectile to gain the advantage. Hitting another player will make them lose their snowball regardless of the size, but be careful if they block it!
- **Knockback Multiplier**: Knock your opponent out of the arena using your snowball's size for powerful force.
